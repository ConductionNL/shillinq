/**
 * FleetAppId — resolve a Conduction fleet app's installed id across the rename.
 *
 * The fleet is mid-rename: `openconnector` became `integriq`, `docudesk`
 * became `filinq`, and so on. The new id has landed on each app's
 * `development` branch, but `beta` and `main` still ship the old one, so at
 * any given moment the id a running instance answers to depends on which
 * branch that app was deployed from.
 *
 * That matters because every cross-app reference is a DUCK-TYPED RUNTIME
 * LOOKUP. `IAppManager::isInstalled('openconnector')` against an instance
 * running `integriq` does not error — it returns false, and the integration
 * silently does nothing. A hard swap to the new id has the same failure in
 * the other direction against a beta/main deployment.
 *
 * So neither id alone is correct. This resolver takes a LIST, newest first,
 * and returns whichever the instance actually has. Callers ask for the
 * canonical (new) name and get back the id that is really installed.
