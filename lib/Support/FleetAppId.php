/**
 * FleetAppId — resolve a Conduction fleet app's installed id across the rename.
 *
 * The fleet renamed: `openconnector` became `integriq`, `docudesk` became
 * `filinq`, and so on. As of September 2026 the new names have reached
 * `main`, `beta` and `development` alike, so a current instance answers to the
 * new id — but an instance pinned to an older release still answers only to
 * the old one, and both are in the field at once.
 *
 * That matters because every cross-app reference is a DUCK-TYPED RUNTIME
 * LOOKUP. `IAppManager::isInstalled('openconnector')` against an instance
 * running `integriq` does not error — it returns false, and the integration
 * silently does nothing. A hard swap to the new id has the same failure in
 * the other direction against an older deployment.
 *
 * So neither name alone is correct. This resolver takes a LIST, newest first,
 * and returns whichever the instance actually has. Callers ask for the
 * canonical (new) name and get back the identity that really exists.
 *
 * The rename moved TWO things — the app id and the PHP namespace — and each
 * breaks its own set of call sites. `resolve()`, `isInstalled()` and
 * `appPath()` cover the id. `classCandidates()`, `resolveClass()`,
 * `getService()` and `isInstanceOf()` cover the namespace. Fixing one half
 * and not the other leaves the integration just as dark, which is how thirteen
 * filinq bindings across five apps stayed broken for a fortnight.
