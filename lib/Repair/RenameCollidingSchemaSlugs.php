/**
 * Shillinq RenameCollidingSchemaSlugs repair step.
 *
 * Moves this app's share of the cross-app slug collisions onto namespaced slugs IN
 * PLACE, before the register import.
 *
 * A schema slug is global per organisation and `SchemaMapper::find()` matches
 * `LOWER(slug)`, so when two apps declare one slug the lookup answers with whichever
 * row it reached first.
 *
 * `Employee` is this app's payroll and detachering facet of a person: contract type,
 * tax classification, GL salary-expense account, placement agency. humaniq's is the
 * person. They share `bsn` and `employeeNumber`, which is exactly the evidence that
 * they are one person and not two, so this side is renamed to say what it is and
 * gains an `employee` uuid pointing at humaniq's record.
 *
 * Why a repair step and why before the import. OpenRegister matches an existing schema
 * by (application, slug): `ImportHandler` calls `findByApplicationAndSlug()` and
 * creates a NEW schema when that misses. A slug rename in the shipped fragment
 * therefore does not rename anything, it CREATES a second schema and silently orphans
 * the first together with every object already written against it. The old schema keeps
 * its shard table and its rows; the app resolves the new id and reads an empty
 * collection. Nothing errors.
 *
 * Separate from {@see RenameCommitmentSchemas}, which is the Dutch-to-English
 * vocabulary pass. Folding these into that map would say they are the same migration,
 * and the next person reading it would have no way to tell why `Employee` is in a list
 * of verplichtingen schemas.
