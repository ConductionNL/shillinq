/**
 * Installs this app's demo dataset on request (ADR-111).
 *
 * An app installed from the App Store opens on an empty list, and the only
 * question its first reader has is whether they can see it work. Answering it
 * requires data they cannot author, against a schema they do not know yet.
 *
 * This service imports `lib/Settings/shillinq_mock_register.json` — a `type: mock` descriptor
 * whose every object was generated from the schema that validates it —
 * through the same OpenRegister importer the app already uses for its real
 * configuration.
 *
 * 🔴 ON DEMAND ONLY, NEVER ON INSTALL. A mock register has no Repair step and
 * is not imported at boot: demo objects appearing unasked on a production
 * instance are indistinguishable from real records to everyone who did not
 * install it. The operator asks, through the setup walkthrough or `occ`.
 *
 * 🔴 AND `force: true`, DELIBERATELY. OpenRegister's importer version-gates a
 * non-forced import and SKIPS silently when the version has not moved. An
 * operator who clicks "install demo data" and is told it succeeded, on an
 * instance where nothing was written, has been lied to by a version compare.
 * The request is explicit, so the import is unconditional.
